# Expaste

ExPaste is a pastebin with socket support! This means that you can live preview
the paste you're about to create.

To be able to share a session you need to send the link to the people you want
to invite. When they've join the session you'll all be able to see what you're
pasting in realtime.

## Creating a paste

Nothing fancy to here, just notice the green button which will copy a URL to
your clipboard which you can share with your friends so they can see you hack
in realtime!

## Stored pastes

All pastes will be stored in the project root. They're highlighted with
[Google Prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify)

Pastes can be viewed in a somewhat mobile friendly format.
